# Glossary

Below are some important definitions. A useful, general glossary of geological terms is found on [opengeology.org](https://opengeology.org/textbook/glossary/)


```{glossary}
Cloud Computing
     the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.[2] Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and economies of scale (Wikipedia)

JupyterHub 
    brings the power of notebooks to groups of users. It gives users access to computational environments and resources without burdening the users with installation and maintenance tasks. Users - including students, researchers, and data scientists - can get their work done in their own workspaces on shared resources which can be managed efficiently by system administrators.
